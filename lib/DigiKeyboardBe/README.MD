# DigiKeyboardBe
###### *Now Available on arduino library manager*
A libray that alow to use a **Belgian AZERTY** Keyboard with Digispark. This code is a slightly modified version of [Robotechnic's version](https://github.com/Robotechnic/DigiKeyboardFr).

For this library, I basically just forked the French keyboard version to which I modified the key mapping to match my own belgian keyboard layout. 


## Releases:
### Release 1.0.0:
* Shameless rip off the original french keyboard library.
* Mapping of the belgian keyboard layout
