sentence=Hardware-based Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) for AVR ATtiny85-based boards using ATTinyCore up to 500 kHz.
paragraph=This hardware-based Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM) library enables you to use the Hardware-PWM on Arduino AVR ATtiny85-based boards (Digispark) using ATTinyCore. The Timer/Counter1 is used in asynchronous mode to give a PWM-output on Pin PB1 or PB4 up to 500 kHz. The maximum resolution is 8-bit.
